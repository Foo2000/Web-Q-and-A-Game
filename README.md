# Web Q&A Game
A web game that you can answer questions to win gold. Link for the website: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~zfu5/

In each room, the player can either answer the question or enter the command to go to other rooms.

If the answer is correct, the player gets 10 gold pieces. Otherwise, the player pays 5 gold pieces. 

When the player cannot pay, he dies. When the player owns 100 gold pieces, he wins.

This is a McGill COMP206 course project. Each room is developed by a COMP206 student. The code here is for my room. The website is based on McGill server.
